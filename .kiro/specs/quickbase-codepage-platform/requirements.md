# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QuickBase Codepage Development Platform is a comprehensive system that enables car dealership staff to build, test, and maintain QuickBase codepages and applications. The platform provides tools for creating interactive calculators (like pricing calculators), managing application schemas, and iterating on codepage functionality using the QuickBase MCP server integration.

## Glossary

- **QuickBase_MCP_Server**: The Model Context Protocol server that provides programmatic access to QuickBase APIs
- **Codepage_Platform**: The web-based development environment for creating and testing QuickBase codepages
- **Pricing_Calculator**: A specific type of codepage that calculates vehicle pricing based on various parameters
- **Schema_Manager**: The component responsible for managing QuickBase application table structures and relationships
- **CDN_Hero**: The quickbase_codepage_hero.js library served via CDN for codepage functionality
- **Test_Environment**: A sandboxed environment for testing codepage functionality before deployment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a dealership developer, I want to create and edit QuickBase codepages through a web interface, so that I can build custom business logic without directly writing complex JavaScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer accesses the codepage editor, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL display a code editor with syntax highlighting for JavaScript
2. WHEN the developer saves a codepage, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL validate the JavaScript syntax and display any errors
3. WHEN the developer requests codepage templates, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL provide pre-built templates for common dealership functions
4. WHERE the developer selects a pricing calculator template, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL generate starter code with vehicle pricing logic
5. THE Codepage_Platform SHALL integrate the CDN_Hero library automatically into all codepage projects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a dealership manager, I want to test codepages in a safe environment before deploying them, so that I can ensure they work correctly without affecting live data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates codepage testing, THE Test_Environment SHALL create an isolated sandbox with test data
2. WHEN the codepage executes in the test environment, THE Test_Environment SHALL capture all API calls and responses for review
3. IF a codepage error occurs during testing, THEN THE Test_Environment SHALL display detailed error information and stack traces
4. WHEN testing completes successfully, THE Test_Environment SHALL generate a test report with performance metrics
5. THE Test_Environment SHALL prevent any modifications to production QuickBase data during testing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a dealership administrator, I want to manage QuickBase application schemas through the platform, so that I can maintain consistent data structures across all dealership applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses schema management, THE Schema_Manager SHALL display all tables and fields in the QuickBase application
2. WHEN the administrator creates a new field, THE Schema_Manager SHALL validate field properties and create the field via QuickBase_MCP_Server
3. WHEN the administrator modifies table relationships, THE Schema_Manager SHALL update the relationships and validate data integrity
4. WHILE schema changes are being applied, THE Schema_Manager SHALL display progress indicators and prevent concurrent modifications
5. THE Schema_Manager SHALL maintain a change log of all schema modifications with timestamps and user information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a dealership sales person, I want to use interactive pricing calculators built with the platform, so that I can quickly generate accurate vehicle quotes for customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sales person opens a pricing calculator, THE Pricing_Calculator SHALL load current vehicle inventory and pricing data from QuickBase
2. WHEN the sales person selects vehicle options, THE Pricing_Calculator SHALL update the total price in real-time
3. WHEN the sales person applies discounts or incentives, THE Pricing_Calculator SHALL recalculate pricing according to dealership rules
4. WHEN the calculation is complete, THE Pricing_Calculator SHALL save the quote to QuickBase with all selected options
5. THE Pricing_Calculator SHALL display financing options and monthly payment calculations based on current rates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to monitor codepage performance and usage, so that I can optimize the system and identify issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN codepages execute, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL log execution times and resource usage metrics
2. WHEN API calls are made to QuickBase, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL track response times and error rates
3. IF codepage execution exceeds performance thresholds, THEN THE Codepage_Platform SHALL alert administrators
4. WHEN administrators request usage reports, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL generate analytics showing codepage usage patterns
5. THE Codepage_Platform SHALL maintain audit logs of all codepage deployments and modifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a dealership developer, I want to version control my codepages and collaborate with team members, so that I can maintain code quality and track changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer saves codepage changes, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL create a new version with timestamp and author information
2. WHEN the developer requests version history, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL display all previous versions with change summaries
3. WHEN the developer compares versions, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL highlight differences between codepage versions
4. WHERE multiple developers work on the same codepage, THE Codepage_Platform SHALL prevent conflicting simultaneous edits
5. THE Codepage_Platform SHALL allow developers to revert to previous codepage versions when needed
