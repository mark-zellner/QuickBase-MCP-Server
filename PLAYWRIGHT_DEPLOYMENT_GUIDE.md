```

## Full Automation Sequence

The agent will execute this sequence:

```javascript
// 1. Navigate to edit page
await mcp.playwright.navigate("https://vibe.quickbase.com/db/bvhuaz7pn?a=dbpage&pageID=2&edit=1");

// 2. Wait for load
await mcp.playwright.wait_for({ time: 3 });

// 3. Get page snapshot to find editor
const snapshot = await mcp.playwright.snapshot();

// 4. Find code editor element reference
const editorRef = findElement(snapshot, "textarea[name='pagebody']");

// 5. Click editor
await mcp.playwright.click({ element: "code editor", ref: editorRef });

// 6. Select all
await mcp.playwright.press_key({ key: "Control+A" });

// 7. Type new code
const code = fs.readFileSync('MyDealership.html', 'utf8');
await mcp.playwright.type({
  element: "code editor",
  ref: editorRef,
  text: code,
  slowly: false
});

// 8. Find and click Save button
const saveRef = findElement(snapshot, "button:contains('Save')");
await mcp.playwright.click({ element: "Save button", ref: saveRef });

// 9. Wait for save
await mcp.playwright.wait_for({ time: 3 });

// 10. Verify deployment
await mcp.playwright.navigate("https://vibe.quickbase.com/db/bvhuaz7pn?a=dbpage&pageID=2");

// 11. Check if our code is live
const verifySnapshot = await mcp.playwright.snapshot();
const hasTestButton = verifySnapshot.includes('Test Connection');

console.log(`Deployment ${hasTestButton ? 'SUCCESS ‚úÖ' : 'FAILED ‚ùå'}`);
```

## Instructions for Agent

**USER REQUEST:**
"Deploy MyDealership.html to pageID=2 using Playwright MCP browser automation"

**AGENT ACTIONS:**
1. Read MyDealership.html content
2. Navigate to edit URL with `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate`
3. Get page snapshot with `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot`
4. Find editor element reference from snapshot
5. Click editor, select all, paste code using Playwright tools
6. Click Save button
7. Verify deployment by navigating to view URL
8. Confirm our code is live

**EXPECTED RESULT:**
- MyDealership v2.0.0 deployed to pageID=2
- No manual steps required
- Full automation via Playwright MCP
- Screenshots saved for verification

## Notes

### Element Selection Strategy
QuickBase code page editor uses either:
- `<textarea name="pagebody">` (plain HTML editor)
- `.CodeMirror` class (if CodeMirror editor)
- `[contenteditable="true"]` (rich text editor)

The Playwright snapshot will tell us which one exists.

### Large Code Handling
MyDealership.html is 38,066 characters. Playwright's `type` tool may have limits.

**Fallback Options:**
1. Use `evaluate` to set textarea value directly:
   ```javascript
   await mcp.playwright.evaluate({
     function: "() => { document.querySelector('textarea[name=pagebody]').value = `${code}`; }"
   });
   ```

2. Use clipboard (Playwright has clipboard APIs):
   ```javascript
   await page.evaluate(code => navigator.clipboard.writeText(code), code);
   await page.keyboard.press('Control+V');
   ```

## Ready to Execute!

The plan is ready. Agent can now:
1. Load MyDealership.html
2. Execute Playwright MCP automation sequence
3. Deploy to production

**Total Time: ~30 seconds** (all automated!) ‚ö°
