## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Paste Doesn't Work
The code might have been cleared from clipboard. Reload it:
```bash
node deploy-automated.js MyDealership.html --page-id 2 --version 2.0.0
```

### If Save Fails in QuickBase
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify you're logged into QuickBase
3. Confirm you have edit permissions for pageID=2

### If Test Connection Fails
Run the backend test to verify table access:
```bash
node test-deployment.js 2
```

### If Save to QuickBase Fails
- **Check**: Pricing table ID is correct (bvhuaz8wz)
- **Verify**: Field IDs match (7=MSRP, 8=Discount, etc.)
- **Confirm**: You have write permissions to the table

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Deployment Successful** if:
1. Code pastes cleanly into editor
2. "Save & Close" works without errors
3. "🔍 Test Connection" shows success
